# the ethical hacker
*ethics are a funny and relative thing*

## prelude
*this is an ode to the hackers, and a call-to-action for any programmer who
strives to be different from the copy-pastas that our higher learning institutions
are churning out*

## what do church-going Mormons and angsty teenagers on LSD have in common?

They share a search for a higher power. They're searching for the universal
point of non-contention, for an example of something that is definitely "right"
or "wrong" in a life so full of grey area and "human nature".

Most people have an uncanny propensity to waste large chunks of their lives
looking for this sense of absoluteness. I'd like to think I dodged that bullet.
I won't say my way is better, but I'm quite glad that 4 years ago, I decided --
not some passive life-movement kind of decision, but in an introspective
pow-wow of "Who-am-I?" one dusty, starry night -- never again to question what I
valued. Instead of spending my ages 20-25 running away from my values, so that I
could have a mid-life crisis by 30, I veered sharp-left off the beaten path and
decided to accept whatever I could best qualify as "my values" at the time to be
my own personal doctrine for the forseeable future. The impacts of this decision
are numerous and far-reaching, and what I have to say about where I am today is
the post that follows below.

Yes, all of this has a point.

## clearly, the pursuit of knowledge

As a hacker, self-proclaimed Pythonista, self-employed internet junkie, with a
self-made web platform and a self-taught background, my most obvious virtue lies
in the pursuit of knowledge. I owe it to myself to understand everything I can
come to learn, and I owe it to my fellow man to be the best trained ape I can
be.

## naturally, a quest for self reliance

As a 4-year burningman veteren (tix? tix? anyone got tix?) I've learned to
depend on myself for silly little things like water and food and making sure I
don't accidentally die. Moreover, I've learned to *value* self-reliance as a
highly-important factor in happiness and perceived self-worth. For this reason,
I own my own servers, I compile my own software, I write my own frameworks, and
I run my own business. I don't feel I have something unless I have all of it,
full control of it, and I can do it myself. Not everyone is built this way, and
I might go grey early, but I wouldn't want to live a day in anybody else's
shoes.

## selfishly, a fair bit of fun

For a knowledge worker, or anyone expected to produce creative results as part
of their day-job, emotional state is a critical factor. Time is not fungible --
you can't simply take off work 7 hours early today and work 7 hours late
tomorrow, because the work quality will differ -- and keeping your time
valuable to yourself and valueable to your work usually means leveraging a clever
dance of a) liberally wasting free time on enjoyable exploits, and b) making sure
that time-spent-working is time you are feeling happy, confident and focused. 

## and the magic ingredient, jackassery

And to roll it all up, one needs a hefty dose of ego. Let's be frank, for a
moment, shall we? I've spent the last 4 years working in the marketing
community, so "what sells" is a hot topic of conversation for me and my friends.
And attitude is one thing that definitely sells. And if you do some
napkin-calculations really fast, it's not hard to figure that probably less than
1% of the world can write code, and probably less than 1% of those code writers
are at a true "hacker" level. So it's not fair to sell yourself short with modesty.
It's not fair to rent your time for minimum wage. I'm not an elitist, but...
Well, yes, OK, I am an elitist. I feel coding is a basic toolset everybody has
available to them, and I feel those who chose to pursue it are clearly smarter
and better prepared than everyone else who lets coders build projects for them.
See ^^ two paragraphs up for my thoughts on owning your own shit.

I look forward to a day when coding is not an option. In the meanwhile, I feel
the best I can do is to talk about myself like what I do is legendary, while
charging high freelance rates and never giving no fucks what nobody says. 
It's usually playful, I try not to "talk trash" or offend people,
but when I fix bugs or build servers or make pretty UIs, I say things like 

    "*SHAPOW*, I'm throwing thunderbolts down from heaven!" 

or maybe I will shout, loud enough to scare everyone in the room,

    "WIZARD MAGICK CODE NINJA FROM THE FOURTH DIMENSION, WINNING"

There is a fine line between a Chuck Norris joke and a Charlie Sheen rant, and I
dance carefully down it.

Give it a try sometime. You are a (wo)man who makes computers dance like puppets
in front of a fire. You could sell lemonade at a roadside stand all day, but
you'd rather just leave a robot there to do it for you. You regularly manipulate
both space and time to achieve your goals, and goddamnit, you deserve to feel like 
a Norse god on regular occasions. When you meet another hacker like us, you
treat them with equal legendary regard. As a brief and crude example, one hacker
should never admit to a mortal that another hacker is pooping -- 
They are "fixing some deep plumbing issues" or "re-routing output to /dev/null".

## has all led me to this

Nothing bothers me more than a lazy hacker. This is someone I consider to be at
my own level, or greater, who will tinker and solve problems and build code, but
doesn't see eye-to-eye with my views on self-reliance. This is someone who takes
$20/hour for building web backends, contributing to the flood of misinformed
business owners who tell me to fuck off when I quote $165/h. This is a coder who
copy-pastes a whole class file, or writes his own ORM because he thinks he knows
better than every other ORM author in history, or freelance a project only to lie
about working "40 hours" when all he really did was play StarCraft. I so rarely
chew people out to their face, but if you match the above description, you sicken
me, and you are ruining a beautiful thing.

It's worth noting that the majority of those whom I consider to be "hackers"
are employed at big companies working on big projects. This vast classification
of coders, I consider to be in the caterpillar phases of self-empowerment. Most
will never grow restless of working for someone else, but joining the freelance
workforce is a honored tradition for caterpillars growing into butterflies. If
you fit this description, and you're thinking about going freelance soon,
consider this rant like a warning-post at the head of the long, dusty road
you're about to venture down. You'll likely ignore it and it will mean nothing
to you, until one day you are like "Damn, really should have listened to that
cocky Lee guy."

If you are a hacker, a creater, a tester, a builder, a do-er, one of my kind
of people, one of my tribe, I will continue to preach my zealotry at you. If I
haven't met you yet, introduce yourself, and prepare for me to talk nonsense
until I feel everything coming out of your head represents the better interests
of the human race. I'm on a mission to change the world, and it starts with
fixing hacker culture.

Love, peace and chicken grease
